defmodule Ring do
  @moduledoc """
  Process ring implementation in Elixir

  Create a ring of `n` processes where the parent process knows the
  child process so that it can send messages to it.

  Every process should wait for a message and then forward it to its
  child process. The message should keep a counter that will
  incremented every time the message is sent so that we can check if
  the whole ring is completed.

  We should be able to make `m` rounds of messages in the ring and
  benchmark how much time does it take.

  Ideas:
  - Create a message to shutdown the ring
  - Create a ring where the root of the ring is not the current process
  - Shutdown the ring by killing the root of the ring
  - Implement the ring with OTP `GenServer`s and benchmark the difference
  - Implement the Ring behaviour by refactoring the `GenServer` implementation
